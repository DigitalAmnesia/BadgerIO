# FullStackProject1
https://bpgould.github.io/FullStackProject1/
This project was completed by Mike Hill, Bennett Gould, Habby Olusesi, and Elijah Melanson.
Within the project, we utilize the Materialize (Google) front end library, various Google APIs, and Google Firebase for a mBaaS (Mobile Backend-as-a-Service).

Alt atributes, aria-labels, font-sizing convention, and other guidelines were used to maximize accessibility and SEO performance. Maximum cacheing time of 10 minutes could not be increased due to GitHub Pages limitations. We have also deployed on Google Cloud with a CloudFlare CDN and are continuing to optimize settings there.

Further improvements:
(1) For client security, only allow GitHub Pages/ Google Cloud domains for Firebase API key
(2) Add additional login options including Apple and Facebook
(3) Implement HTML5 templating 
(4) Build out user profile capability and API key user attributes stored in Firebase
